# HackYourFuture - AWS Serverless MASTERCLASS

The masterclass is planned to be 6 weeks on Thursdays from 13:00 to 16:00(3hours) except for the last day that will be on a Friday and from 10:00 to 15:00(5hours) and these are the dates:

  1. Week01 - 08/09/2022 (Thursday)
  2. Week02 - 15/09/2022 (Thursday)
  3. Week03 - 22/09/2022 (Thursday)
  4. Week04 - 29/09/2022 (Thursday)
  5. Week05 - 06/10/2022 (Thursday)
  6. Week06 - 14/10/2022 (Friday)
  
Masterclass will be held at the AWS Office (Ny Carlsberg Vej 80, Copenhagen 1760, Denmark) except for the last session on the 14/10/2022 that will be held at the HackYourFuture Office (Danneskiold-Samsøes Allé 41, 1434 København) and it will NOT be possible to join the class online.

In this 6-week module we will build a serverless application from scratch using AWS services. 

To get more specific, the students will gain knowledge on how to:
- deploy, host and manage static web applications in the cloud
- create serverless REST or GraphQL APIs
- create timebased, event-based and trigger based Lambda functions

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills or the Javascript module courses offered by Hack Your Future.
- In order to attend this Masterclass, we recommend that you have foundational cloud practitioner skills (15 hours of training). 

You can pursue the course AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials on [AWS Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials) or on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials). 

You can also pursue a new game-based role-playing experience, called [AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/11458/aws-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner). AWS Cloud Quest teaches foundational cloud computing concepts while learners zap drones and collect gems in their quest to solve challenges in a virtual city.

## Preparation

Materials and guides from the preparation section for each week should be read before class. Mandatory homework exercises should also be completed on a weekly basis.

## Environment setup

This course assumes that you have an existing AWS environment. 

We will go through environment setup in the first week of the course.
