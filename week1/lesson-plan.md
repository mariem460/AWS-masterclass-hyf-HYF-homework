# Week 1 

## Agenda
- Meet and greet - 30 minutes
- Introduction to the cloud - 30 minutes
- Introduction to serverless - 1 hour
- Setup of base environment - 1 hour

## Core services 

We focus on services provided by AWS, namely the following:
- AWS Lambda Functions (compute)
- Amazon Simple Storage Service or S3 (storage)
- Amazon DynamoDB (databases)
- Amazon EventBridge and AWS Step Functions (orchestriation)

## Setup of base environment

We will be using [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) as a standardized cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE). It lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this masterclass.

Your Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS Management Console. 

Follow the instructions in the [homework assignment section](/week1/homework.md) to setup Cloud9.
